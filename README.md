# sudoku-solver
A simple sudoku-solver, produced mainly as an exercise in breaking up problems into sensible pieces. With that in mind, I refrained from referencing any external sources on solving sudoku puzzles (or writing the code therein). The resulting program can solve a medium-difficulty sudoku, and some hard-difficulty sudoku puzzles, but was not capable of solving the hardest puzzles, where the number for no individual square can be deduced simply, which is also beyond my personal ability at sudoku. 

So, not being an expert in sudoku, I feel this was a success, as I managed to code up a program which could solve sudoku to the same level I can, (and in a tiny fraction of the time of course).
